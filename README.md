 TREE PROJECT

There is a real program developed by a computer company that reads a report ( running text ) and issues warnings on style and partially correct bad style. You are to write a simplified version of this program with the following features:

Statistics

A statistical summary with the following information:
    • Total number of words in the report
    • Number of unique words
    • Number of unique words of more than three letters
    • Average word length 
    • Average sentence length
    • An index (alphabetical listing) of all the unique words (see next page for a specific format) 

Style Warnings

Issue a warning in the following cases:
    • Word used too often: list each unique word of more than three letters if its usage is more than 5% of the total number of words of more than three letters
    • Sentence length : write a warning message if the average sentence length is greater than 10
    • Word length : write a warning message if the average word length is greater than 5

Input

From the keyboard:  The name of the file containing the text to be analyzed
From the file:  The report to be analyzed. 

Output

1. Write the following information to a file:
    • The name of the input file
    • The statistical summary of the report ( see Statistics above )
    • The style warnings ( see Style Warnings above )

Data Structures

2. A binary search tree of unique words in the report, created as the file is read. If a word is not in the list, put it there. If it is, increment a counter showing how many times the word has been used.

Definitions:

Word: Sequence of letters ending in a blank, a period, an exclamation point, a question mark, a colon, a comma, a single quote, or a semicolon. You may assume that numbers do not appear in the words; they may be ignored.
Unique word: Words that are spelled the same, ignoring uppercase and lowercase distinctions.
Sentence: Words between end of markers.

STATISTICAL SUMMARY

TOTAL NUMBER OF WORDS: 987
TOTAL NUMBER OF “UNIQUE” WORDS: 679
TOTAL NUMBER OF “UNIQUE” WORDS OF MORE THAN THREE LETTERS: 354
AVERAGE WORD LENGTH: 8 characters 
AVERAGE SENTENCE LENGTH: 12 words

STLE WARNINGS

WORDS USED TOO OFTEN: (  WORDS OF MORE THAN 3 LETTERS THAT ARE USED MORE THAN 5% OF THE TOTAL NUMBER   OF WORDS OF MORE THAN 3 LETTERS )

1) Well
2) Total
3) Good
4) Since
5) Because
6) Little 

AVERAGE SENTENCE LENGTH TOO LONG – 12 words
AVERAGE WORD LENGTH TOO LONG – 8 characters
